Radiative Muon Capture Background Study 
===

###Introduction
This part is intended for Radiative Muon Capture (RMC) background study in Cylindrical Drift Chamber (CDC) detector for COMET Phase-I experiment.  

Since the time structure of RMC is supposed to be the same with signal -- they all come from stopped &mu; -- the suppression of this part of backgroud can not benifit from pulsed beam structure.  

The background contribution during the whole physics run can be estimated as:  
N<sub>bkg</sub> = N<sub>p</sub> &times; R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub> &times; R<sub>cap</sub> &times; Br<sub>RMC</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-ph</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-e</sub> &times; A<sub>geo</sub> &times; R<sub>time</sub> &times; E<sub>rec</sub> &times; R<sub>mom</sub>

*	N<sub>p</sub>: Total number of initial protons.
*	R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub>: Number of &mu; stoped in stopping target per initial proton.
*	R<sub>cap</sub> &times: &mu; capture ratio in stopping target.
*	Br<sub>RMC</sub>: Branching ratio of Radiative Muon Capture relatively to Normal Radiative Muon Capture
*	R<sub>HE-ph</sub>: Number of high Energy RMC photons (Above 101MeV) per RMC photon.
*	R<sub>HE-e</sub>: Numebr of high Energy electrons (momentum above 101MeV/c) generated by one high Energy RMC photon.
*	A<sub>geo</sub>: Geometry acceptance of detector (i.e. CDC for COMET Phase-I).
*	R<sub>time</sub>: Time window cut ratio.
*	E<sub>rec</sub>: Reconstruction efficiency.
*	R<sub>mom</sub>: Momentum selection cut ratio.

###Investigation
#####N<sub>p</sub>
Previous decision written in COMET Phase-I proposal is ...
N<sub>p</sub> = 3.8 &times; 10<sup>18</sup>
Error estimation
#####R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub>
To study this part, a simulation from production target to stopping target should be done.  
I plan to use comet_g4 to simulate from production target to the entrance of CDC detector (``Simulation-1``) and use my own Geant4 simulation tool to simulate from the entrance to stopping target (``Simulation-2``).  
Further study can be found in next section.
#####R<sub>cap</sub>
This can be found in papar ... R<sub>cap</sub> = 0.61 for Aluminum.
Error estimation:
#####Br<sub>RMC</sub>
This can be found in papar ... Br<sub>RMC</sub> = 6.7 &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> for Aluminum.
Error estimation:
#####R<sub>HE-ph</sub>
In order to get this number we have to know the tail shape of RMC spectrum.  
In paper ... x (x=E/E<sub>max</sub>) in RMC follows this emperical formula ...  
E<sub>max</sub> can be estimated as: E<sub>max</sub> = m<sub>&mu;</sub> + M<sub>Z</sub> - M<sub>Z-1</sub> - m<sub>e</sub>  
Where m<sub>&mu;</sub> is the mass of &mu;, m<sub>e</sub> is the mass of electron, M<sub>Z</sub> is the mass of initial atom (i.e. Al) and M<sub>Z-1</sub> is the mass of final state atom (i.e. Mg).  
According to ... Aluminum is 100% Al<sup>27</sup>, so final atom is Mg<sup>27</sup>  
According to ... M<sub>Al<sup>27</sup></sub> = 26.98153863 u, M<sub>Mg<sup>27</sup></sub> = 26.98434059 u.
So in sum, E<sub>max</sub> = 102.5374 MeV.  
With these informations above, I can draw the spectrom like:...  
Study of this part can be found in ``RMCSpectrum``.  
R<sub>HE-ph</sub> = 1.361 &times; 10<sup>5</sup>.  
#####R<sub>HE-e</sub> &times; A<sub>geo</sub> &times; R<sub>time</sub>
These factors will be studied as a whole.  
As we know, in material photons can introduce elctrons through Compton Scattering or Pair Production (Gamma Conversion) processes, and there is a chance for those electrons finally reached CDC chamber and left some signal.
I plan to use ``Simulation-2`` to get the profile of stopped &mu; in stopping target and start another simulation from emmited photons based on the spectrum of high energy RMC photons I mentioned above with my own Geant4 simulation tool (``simulation-3``) and see how many high energy (momentum above 101MeV/c) electrons got accepted by CDC eventrually.  
Further study can be found in next section.
#####E<sub>rec</sub> &times; R<sub>mom</sub>
These factors will be studied as a whole.  
To get this number we need to do another simulation from those high energy elections accepted by CDC and do a proper reconstruction later.  
Based on the profile I got from ``simulation-3`` further study is done by Sakamoto-san with his Genfit-Geant3 tool.  
Detail and result will be shown in following section.

###Simulation study
#####Simulation-1: comet_g4 simulation from production target to the entrance of CDC detector
Results of this part can be found in [Beam](https://github.com/wuchen1106/MyStudies/tree/master/Beam)

#####Simulation-2: get the profile of stopped &mu
Results is put in ``MuonStop``
Got totally 4663123 &mu; stopped out of 800*15M initial protons, so R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub> = 3.886 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup>  
R<sub>cap</sub> = 61%

#####Simulation-3: get the profile of stopped &mu
