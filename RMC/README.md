Radiative Muon Capture Background Study 
===

###Introduction
This part is intended for Radiative Muon Capture (RMC) background study in Cylindrical Drift Chamber (CDC) detector for COMET Phase-I experiment.  

Muon Capture is analogy to electron capture. It is given by  
&mu;<sup>-</sup> + N(A,Z) &rarr; &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub> + N(A,Z-1)  
During this process, &gamma;s, neutrons and charged particles may be emitted and would become sources of fake signals.  
Radiative muon capture (RMC)  
&mu;<sup>-</sup> + N(A,Z) &rarr; &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub> + N(A,Z-1) + &gamma;.  
followed by asymmetric e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> conversion of the photon or Compton Scattering is another source of intrinsic background events.

The background contribution during the whole physics run can be estimated as:  
**N<sub>bkg</sub> = N<sub>p</sub> &times; R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub> &times; R<sub>cap</sub> &times; Br<sub>RMC</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-ph</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-e</sub> &times; A<sub>geo</sub> &times; A<sub>time</sub> &times; E<sub>rec</sub> &times; R<sub>mom</sub>**

*	**N<sub>p</sub>**: Total number of initial protons.
*	**R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub>**: Number of &mu; stoped in stopping target per initial proton.
*	**R<sub>cap</sub>**: &mu; capture ratio in stopping target.
*	**Br<sub>RMC</sub>**: Branching ratio of Radiative Muon Capture relatively to Normal Radiative Muon Capture
*	**R<sub>HE-ph</sub>**: Number of high Energy RMC photons (Above 100MeV) per RMC photon.
*	**R<sub>HE-e</sub>**: Numebr of high Energy electrons (momentum above 100MeV/c) generated by one high Energy RMC photon.
*	**A<sub>geo</sub>**: Geometry acceptance of detector (i.e. CDC for COMET Phase-I).
*	**A<sub>time</sub>**: Time window cut ratio.
*	**E<sub>rec</sub>**: Reconstruction efficiency.
*	**R<sub>mom</sub>**: Momentum selection cut ratio.

Normalized to Single Signal event this number will become:
**N<sub>bkg_norm</sub> = R<sub>cap</sub> &times; Br<sub>RMC</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-ph</sub> &times; R<sub>HE-e</sub> &times; A<sub>geo</sub> &times; A<sub>time</sub> &times; E<sub>rec</sub> &times; R<sub>mom</sub> / [(1-R<sub>cap</sub>)  &times; A<sub>geo_sig</sub> &times; A<sub>time_sig</sub> &times; E<sub>rec_sig</sub> &times; R<sub>mom_sig</sub> ]**  

Further study is supposed to estimate **N<sub>bkg_norm</sub>**.

###Investigation


#####R<sub>cap</sub>
This can be found in papar ...  
**R<sub>cap</sub> = 0.61** for Aluminum.


#####Br<sub>RMC</sub>
This can be found in papar ...  
**Br<sub>RMC</sub> = 6.7&times;10<sup>-5</sup>** for Aluminum.


#####R<sub>HE-ph</sub>
In order to get this number we have to know the tail shape of RMC spectrum.  
In paper ... x (x=E/E<sub>max</sub>) in RMC follows this emperical formula ...  
E<sub>max</sub> can be estimated as: E<sub>max</sub> = m<sub>&mu;</sub> + M<sub>Z</sub> - M<sub>Z-1</sub> - m<sub>e</sub>  - E<sub>bind</sub>  
Where m<sub>&mu;</sub> is the mass of &mu;, m<sub>e</sub> is the mass of electron, M<sub>Z</sub> is the mass of initial atom (i.e. Al), M<sub>Z-1</sub> is the mass of final state atom (i.e. Mg) and E<sub>bind</sub> is the binding energy of &mu; in muonic Aluminum atom.  
According to ... Aluminum is 100% Al<sup>27</sup>, so final atom is Mg<sup>27</sup>  
According to ... M<sub>Al<sup>27</sup></sub> = 26.98153863 u, M<sub>Mg<sup>27</sup></sub> = 26.98434059 u. so M<sub>Z</sub> - M<sub>Z-1</sub> = -2.6100MeV
According to ... Binding energy of ground state electron in Aluminum atom is 1559eV. so  E<sub>bind</sub> can be estimated as 1559eV*m<sub>&mu;</sub>/m<sub>e</sub> = 0.32235MeV
So in sum, E<sub>max</sub> = 105.6584MeV - 2.6100MeV - 0.5110MeV - 0.32235MeV = 102.2150MeV  
With these informations above, I can draw the spectrom like:...  
Study of this part can be found in ``RMCSpectrum``.  
**R<sub>HE-ph</sub> = 6.613&times;10<sup>-5</sup>**. 


#####R<sub>HE-e</sub> &times; A<sub>geo</sub> &times; A<sub>time</sub>
According to ... we can get the profile of beam &mu; at the entrance of CDC.  
... 
Starting from this profile, I started a Geant4 simulation of &mu; transportation in CDC region. Configuration of stopping target is

Magnetic Field is set to uniformly 1T among z direction.  
Geant4 version is 4.9.6 and physics model is QGSP_BERT.  
From this simulation, position and time of stopped &mu; is found to be:  
...  
According to ..., life time of RMC &mu; in Aluminium is 864ns. Applying this to the t<sub>stop</sub> distribution we can get the t<sub>capture</sub> distribution like  
...  

Furthermore, Using the stopping position and t<sub>capture</sub> as the starting point of RMC photons, assuming these photons are emitted isotopically and spectrum can be described by fig?, another Geant4 simulation of photon transportation inside CDC is applied.  
Configuration of stopping target is the same as described above.  
Configuration of Drift Chamber is:

#####E<sub>rec</sub> &times; R<sub>mom</sub>
These factors will be studied as a whole.  
To get this number we need to do another simulation from those high energy elections accepted by CDC and do a proper reconstruction later.  
Based on the profile I got from ``simulation-3`` further study is done by Sakamoto-san with his Genfit-Geant3 tool.  
Detail and result will be shown in following section.

###Simulation study
#####Simulation-1: comet_g4 simulation from production target to the entrance of CDC detector
Results of this part can be found in [Beam](https://github.com/wuchen1106/MyStudies/tree/master/Beam)

#####Simulation-2: get the profile of stopped &mu;
Results is put in ``MuonStop``
Analyzation is done by ``bm.C``
Got totally 4663123 &mu; stopped out of 800*15M initial protons, so **R<sub>&mu;-stop</sub> = 3.886&times;10<sup>-4</sup>**

#####Simulation-3: simulation from emitted photons
Initial position and time can be described by the profile of stopped &mu;
Energy distribution can be described by ``RMCSpectrum`` I mentioned above.
Direction is supposed to be isotopic.
1.5 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> photons were generated in this simulation and 339204 of them are of above 100MeV/c momentum.
So **R<sub>HE-e</sub> = 339204/1.5&times;10<sup>8</sup> = 2.26&times;10<sup>-3</sup>**  
Among them, 92357 hits the CDC, 84632 hits the trigger, and 12276 hit the CDC first so **A<sub>geo</sub> = 12276/339204 = 3.62%**  
Further applying the signal time window of 700ns to 1314ns and initial proton time spread of 100ns, only 3646 electrons of them can survive.
So **R<sub>time</sub> = 3646/12276 = 29.7%**

#####Simulation-4: from emitted electrons
Optional: Use resolution figure to do this study.  
**E<sub>rec</sub> = 90%.**  
**R<sub>mom</sub> = 2.4841&times;10<sup>-5</sup>**
